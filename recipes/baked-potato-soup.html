    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is probably the best soup in the world. It is a good soup for veggie haters. Baking the potatoes first gives them the perfect texture for this thick creamy soup. You won't be disappointed. Serve with crackers and top with a bit more shredded Cheddar, crumbled bacon, and a dollop of sour cream.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>8 large red potatos</li>

        <li>1/2 gallon milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded chedder</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap potatoes in aluminum foil.</li>

        <li>Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble.</li>
